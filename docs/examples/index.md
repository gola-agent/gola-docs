# Examples

This section contains working examples of Gola agents with practical configurations that demonstrate key patterns and capabilities.

## Available Examples

### [Minimal Agent](minimal)
The simplest possible Gola configuration - just an agent name and LLM provider. Perfect for getting started and understanding the basics.

**Features**: Basic conversation, OpenAI integration  
**Use cases**: Learning, prototyping, simple chatbots

### [MCP Tools Agent](mcp)
Demonstrates external tool integration using Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. Includes filesystem, git, and time tools.

**Features**: File operations, git commands, time utilities  
**Use cases**: Development assistance, file management, git automation

### [Sherpa Agent](sherpa)
Advanced finite state machine pattern for complex multi-step workflows. Demonstrates travel planning with external API integration.

**Features**: State persistence, error recovery, external APIs, workflow orchestration  
**Use cases**: Travel planning, e-commerce checkout, approval workflows

## Example Philosophy

All examples follow these principles:

### Production-Ready
Every example uses proven configurations:
- Configurations work reliably across different environments
- Examples follow best practices and conventions
- Patterns are suitable for real-world use cases

### Progressive Complexity
Examples are ordered from simple to advanced:
1. **Minimal** - Pure LLM interaction
2. **MCP Tools** - External tool integration  
3. **Sherpa Agent** - Complex state machine workflows

### Copy-Paste Ready
All configurations are:
- Complete and self-contained
- Include setup instructions
- Provide troubleshooting guidance
- Show expected outputs

### Real-World Focus
Examples demonstrate:
- Production-ready patterns
- Error handling approaches
- Performance considerations
- Security best practices

## Getting Started

1. **Choose an example** that matches your use case
2. **Follow the setup** instructions for prerequisites
3. **Copy the configuration** and customize for your needs
4. **Run and test** to verify everything works
5. **Extend and adapt** for your specific requirements

## Next Steps

- Start with [Minimal Agent](minimal) to understand basics
- Add tools with [MCP Tools](mcp) for enhanced capabilities  
- Build complex workflows with [Sherpa Agent](sherpa) patterns

Each example builds on the previous ones, creating a learning path from simple conversational agents to sophisticated workflow orchestration systems.
